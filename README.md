# Car_Rental_System
 I recently developed a Car Rental System project in Java, applying object-oriented programming principles to simulate a practical car rental scenario. The system allows customers to rent cars from a fleet managed by the program.  Key Features:  Object-Oriented Design: Implemented classes such as Car, Customer, Rental, and CarRentalSystem to encapsulate data and behaviors.  Efficient Data Handling: Utilized Java collections (ArrayList, HashMap) for managing car inventory, customer records, and rental transactions.  User Interaction: Created a command-line interface (CLI) for seamless customer interactions, including renting cars, returning them, and calculating rental prices.  Technical Details:  Exception Handling: Integrated error handling to ensure robustness during user inputs and operations.  Learning Outcomes: Strengthened skills in Java programming, data modeling, and system design through practical application.  Next Steps:  I'm eager to continue expanding this project and exploring more complex software development challenges.
